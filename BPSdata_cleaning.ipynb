    "There are duplicate records in the Roster sheet. Some duplicates seem to indicate multiple roles (e.g., Michael is both a Teacher and Social Worker), and potentially multiple races (e.g., Ivy is both White and Black). There is an ambiguous 'Empl Record' column I do not feel confident enough to use, as the Glossary doesn't specify how to interpret its values. Since this exercise is only concerned with job role, I am going to drop the Race and Sex columns, as well as the Empl Record column. This should allow me to remove duplicates where the Employee ID, First/Last Name, and Job Code/Title are all the same, as my analysis doesn't require knowing whether the person has multiple sexes, races, or Empl Records. It will still leave duplicate IDs where the staff member has multiple roles (e.g., Teacher and Social Worker) so I can categorize the person's role to the best of my knowledge later on. \n",

It's less confusing to drop completely. "

If they can, which Job Title should be preferenced for the Role column (or should there be an additional category for \"in two roles\")? Do certain Job Titles only apply to certain types of classes (e.g., is a Coach role only relevant to certain classroom subjects)? Without that context, the most accurate cleaning method is to separate staff with ambiguous duplicate roles out from those without to be able to sort them out as unconfident matches."
